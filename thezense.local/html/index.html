          <p class="text">The refund excludes shipping fee and shipping insurance fee if applicable.</p>
          <p class="text bold">[Do I need to return the products for a refund?]</p>
          <p class="text">The principal behind product returns and refunds is that any unused products have to be returned.</p>
          <p class="text">At Zense, each set of products is designed to last you one full month (i.e. 30 calendar days). The 30 day guarantee provides you with ample opportunity to experience one full set of products. Should you decide to request a refund, we ask that unused sets of products you may have in your possession to be returned for processing. If your order is made up of only one set of products, there is no need to arrange for returns.</p>
          <p class="text">Return packages should be sent with a Return Authorization Number (RA#) which can be obtained from our customer care team. Returns that do not have this number written on the outside of the package will not be opened and will be returned to sender (at sender’s expense). Please contact our friendly customer care team to get your RA# either via email: <a href="mailto:support@thezense.com">support@thezense.com</a> or via the live chat on our website.</p>
          <p class="text">Please do not send your products to the return address printed on your package. That is not the address of our refund processing center, sending your package there will negatively affect the processing of your return.</p>
